# CS50x 2023 - Lecture 0 - Scratch

## Overview

In this lecture, we began our journey into the exciting world of computer science. Our primary tool of choice for this leg of the journey is Scratch, a visual programming language developed at MIT. The focus of this class is not only on programming but also on the development of essential problem-solving skills, which have broad applicability.

## Key Concepts

1. **Binary Language:** This is the language computers use to represent numbers, using 0s (off) and 1s (on). Even letters are represented by binary patterns of 1s and 0s using ASCII or Unicode standards.

2. **RGB Values:** Red, Green, and Blue values, combined, represent colors. Images are made up of these RGB values.

3. **Algorithms:** These are approaches to problem-solving in computer science. We explored concepts like linear search and binary search.

4. **Pseudocode:** A human-readable version of code, crucial for planning programming logic and communicating it to others.

5. **Scratch:** A syntax-free, visual environment for building programs, including elements like functions, conditionals, boolean expressions, and loops.

6. **Abstraction:** This concept simplifies complex problems into smaller tasks. It is demonstrated in Scratch, where repetitive actions can be streamlined using loops or custom-made blocks (functions).

7. **Sprites:** In Scratch, a sprite refers to an interactive object or character on the screen.

8. **Conditionals:** Involve the program checking a specific condition and taking action if the condition is met.

9. **Debugging:** The process of identifying and resolving issues within a program.

## Hands-On Demonstrations

We took a deep dive into practical applications of Scratch by building several interactive programs:

1. **Greeting Program:** A simple program where an on-screen cat greets a user by their name, demonstrating how inputs are passed to functions and side effects occur as a result.

2. **Oscartime Game:** This game features a sprite, Oscar, that changes costume when hovered over by the mouse. Trash falls from the top, and points are scored when Oscar collects the trash.

3. **Ivy's Hardest Game:** Here, we learned how to move a sprite using keyboard inputs and prevent it from moving off-screen.

4. **Multi-sprite Interactions:** Demonstrated how to use multiple sprites that can move autonomously or follow another sprite around the screen.

Through the use of Scratch, this lecture has equipped us with a solid foundation in the basics of programming and computer science. The problem-solving skills, knowledge of pseudocoding, abstraction, and fundamental building blocks of programming we have gained will undoubtedly serve us well as we continue to explore the vast landscape of computer science.

## Personal Project: Baseball Game in Scratch

In accordance with the requirements of the course, I developed a unique Scratch project that goes beyond the examples shown in the lectures. The project I have undertaken is an interactive baseball game featuring three distinct actors: the baseball player, the ball, and the target.

### Project Description

The user interacts with the game by pressing the space bar in an attempt to hit the ball with the baseball player sprite. The ball always falls from the same location, and the target is stationary. The challenge lies in the timing of the player's swing - it must be perfectly timed with the ball's descent to hit the target.

As the user accumulates points, the ball's speed increases, making the game progressively more challenging. The ball has three different speeds, each one faster than the last. Simultaneously, the target shrinks in size, starting from normal size and shrinking to its minimum size in stages.

### Game Mechanics

The game mechanics involve various elements learned during the lecture:

1. **Multiple Sprites:** The game uses three different sprites (the baseball player, the ball, and the target).

2. **Scripts:** There are numerous scripts controlling the sprites' actions, such as the ball's motion and the player's swing.

3. **Conditional and Loops:** The game uses conditionals to detect whether the ball has been hit and loops to handle the ball's motion and the player's swing.

4. **Variable:** The game uses variables to keep track of the user's score and the ball's speed.

5. **Custom Blocks:** The game features custom blocks, which control the game's increasing difficulty as the user accumulates more points.

This game is a perfect demonstration of the principles taught in the Scratch lecture, illustrating the use of sprites, scripts, conditionals, loops, variables, and custom blocks.
